  "description": "My project, InspirVision, is a Next.js-powered web app designed to be a space of connection for people who struggle with mental health or simply need a calm environment. InspirVision combines my passions for writing, photography, and coding to create a hyper-interactive platform for users to chat, read, and connect with others: featuring catalogs of poetry and other forms of writing paired with photographs, daily quotes (refreshed daily, of course!), a chatroom, brain games, and more. I made this project because I always wanted to make a website, but I wanted to do it with purpose and strong intent, so after a hard year, the idea came to me. A merging of Inspiration and Envisioning, I decided to create InspirVision. Iâ€™ve had the idea slightly planned out for a bit now, but finally locked in and got it fully up and running. I made my project initially with basic HTML, CSS, and JS, but when I learned about NextJS, I dove headfirst into learning that to improve the capabilities of my site, which extended the building period, but paid off because I learned a lot more. I started pretty slowly, aiming to get one page done per day (the bugs took hours..), then finally got to polishing and finished all my major parts. Some stuff I struggled with was the page linking and getting the formatting to look like how I envisioned it in my head. It was pretty difficult at first to get a hang of how the code kind of worked with Next.js, but when I caught on, it was much smoother sailing from there. This project took my web dev skills to the next level, especially since I tried to incorporate a lot of tiny features like image linking, audio, games, etc.",
